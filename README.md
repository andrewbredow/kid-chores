# Kid Chores

Our montessori kids need a way to plan their day, and we are a bit intense about our family schedule. So, we brainstormed a chart that takes care of before school and after school responsibilities for our kids.

Today, it's a pages document which does not make this easy to see on GitHub, but here it is if anyone wants to copy or make it better!
